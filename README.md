## About this app
<p>This app is designed for Platinum Motor Cars to provide a cross-platform mobile application of the existing website. We built it using the Ionic 4 framework. Until it is ready for deployment, we have two custom APIs that we used to gather our data and to manage a local database. These APIs can be found in the following Github repositories:</p>

### Webscraped Data:
